# PI-07 refinement checkpoint review

Status: incomplete R, handed off at budget guard. No A/B/T implementation or
PI milestone acceptance. R acceptance, when granted, is design acceptance only.
Baseline: `428b2ee4957d75f05b11b370df044d625a78abdb`.

Inspected roadmap/routing, PI-05/06 plans/reviews/contracts, ADRs 0001–0003,
actual Content domain/application/SQLite boundaries, lifecycle and backup code,
and legacy TAF validation/library/range evidence. The
[contract checkpoint](pi-07-taf-storage-contract.md) records conclusions and
five remaining gates. The [plan](pi-07-plan.md) and [budget](pi-07-budget.md)
provide bounded continuation, not delivery authorization.

Assumptions: one trusted core owner, qualified local Linux filesystem, immutable
files and synthetic fixtures. Network filesystems, arbitrary same-owner hostile
mutation, public HTTP APIs, conversion/download workers, production migration,
device playback and coordinated media/credential restore are outside this PI
checkpoint. Power-loss and deployment evidence remain unproven.

## Issue disposition

Exact-ID search queries were performed against GitHub for `PI-07/A`, `PI-07/B`,
`PI-07/T` and `PI-07/T-01`, plus checked-in references. Search returned references
in older issues, but no exact A/B/T task identity. Proposed task IDs are
`PI-07/A`, `PI-07/B`, `PI-07/T`; none was published or modified. Recheck exact
identity before later publication. Reuse existing open
[PI-07/T-01 #17](https://github.com/shentschel/teddycloud/issues/17), whose body
was fetched and read. Its evidence belongs inside T. No duplicate missing-media
issue is proposed.

Next action: separately admit completion of the five contract gates, then
independent R review. Do not dispatch A from this partial contract. Existing
PI-06 review accepts T and the transactional Tag milestone; older status text
in its plan is stale, not grounds to repeat completed work.

Verification for this documentation checkpoint is the architecture-document
checker and diff whitespace check; final tool results accompany the handoff.
Implementation tests listed in the plan are future requirements, not passes.
